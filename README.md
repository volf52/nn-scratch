Simple Neural Net implementation with Numpy
=============================================
---
The comments in the code do a good job of explaining what each line does (okay, not each line, but each significant line). As for why do this when there are libraries like Pytorch and mxnet or frameworks like Tensorflow which can do the same stuff but much faster, this is in no way meant to be used for real life models and stuff. It was more of an attempt to understand the concept of backprop in deep neural networks. I thought I knew. I was wrong.
